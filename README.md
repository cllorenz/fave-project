# FaVe - Fast Formal Network Security Verification

This repository contains the codebases of the FaVe project.
FaVe aims to offer accessible and scalable tooling to support network security management processes.
It enables to verify the security compliance of network configurations and provides further insights into firewall rule sets, i.e., by detecting firewall anomalies.
The concept behind FaVe is called _Domain oriented Header Space Analysis_ (DHSA).
In contrast to the original _Header Space Analysis_ by Kazemian et al. (refer to [1]), DHSA offers more accessible yet compatible means to specify policies and model network configuration.
Nevertheless, we reuse the fast _NetPlumber_ (originally by Kazemian et al.) verification engine to solve DHSA instances.

We benchmarked DHSA using several different workloads - synthetic and real-world alike - covering a broad variety of scenarios.
Also, we compared our results with the state of the art by running the benchmark with the tools from [2], [3], [4], and [5].
See our publication list for the results.


## Publications

We published our results in a series of scientific papers:

 - C. Lorenz and B. Schnor, “Policy Anomaly Detection for Distributed IPv6 Firewalls,” in SECRYPT, 2015.
 - C. Lorenz, S. Kiekheben, and B. Schnor, “FaVe: Modeling IPv6 firewalls for fast formal verification,” in NetSys, 2017.
 - C. Lorenz, V. Clemens, M. Schrötter, and B. Schnor, “Continuous Verification of Network Security Compliance,” in IEEE TNSM, 2021.
 - C. Lorenz and B. Schnor, “Firewall Management: Rapid Anomaly Detection,“ in HPCC, 2022 (accepted for publication).


## Repository Overview

This repository is organized as follows:

 - `fave/` - includes the modeling pipeline and a set of management tools
 - `net_plumber/` - includes the NetPlumber verification backend which was published originally in [1]
 - `policy_translator/` - includes the policy management tool [PolicyTranslator](policy_translator/README.md)
 - `ad6` - includes ad6 for anomaly detection in ip6tables rule sets
 - `z3-anomalies` - includes an implementation of [4] to detect anomalies in ip6tables rule sets using the Z3 SMT solver
 - `stl-anomalies` - includes an implementation of [5] to detect anomalies in ip6tables rule sets using the STL algorithm


## First Steps (tested on Ubuntu 20.04)

First, one needs to install some dependencies to compile NetPlumber. The script

    #> net_plumber/setup-ubuntu.sh

performs the necessary steps on an Ubuntu machine. Afterwards, one needs to switch to

    $> cd net_plumber/build/

and then compile NetPlumber using

    $> make all

Then, one can use NetPlumber from the compilation directory or

    #> make install

to install it permanently.

For developers it might be more convenient to link the `net_plumber` binary to some `$PATH` directory like `/usr/bin`.


To set up FaVe one can use the script

    #> fave/setup.sh

Afterwards, one can test the installation running

    $> export PYTHONPATH=fave
    $> python2 fave/test/example.sh

Typically, a session comprises of two processes: `aggregator_service.py` and `net_plumber`. These can be stopped or started using their respective scripts in `fave/scripts`. If one process dies one needs to restart both - first NetPlumber and then FaVe. Logfiles are stored in `/dev/shm/np`.


## Benchmarks

There exist some benchmarks showing the capabilities of FaVe:

 - `fave/bench/wl_example` - A simple example workload.
 - `fave/bench/wl_ifi/` - Implementation of the small IFI benchmark which is a reasonably complex yet still manually explorable network configuration.
 - `fave/bench/wl_up/` - Implementation of the synthetic, mid-sized, and complex UP benchmark which mimics a university campus network.
 - `fave/bench/wl_tum/` - Implementation of the complex TUM-i8 benchmark from literature including a large firewall ruleset.
 - `fave/bench/wl_stanford/` - Implementation of the large Stanford benchmark from literature including ACLs.
 - `fave/bench/wl_i2/` - Implementation of the large Internet2 benchmark from literature.

To run a benchmark `BENCH=fave/bench/wl_your_benchmark_here` use the following commands:

    $> export PYTHONPATH=fave
    $> python2 $BENCH/benchmark.py
