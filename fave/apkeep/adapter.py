""" An AbstractVerificationEngine backed by APKeep (via libapkeep / JPype).

Translates a FaVe model to APKeep (approach B in APKEEP_BACKEND.md): FaVe device
models -> APKeep ForwardElements + dst-IP forwarding rules, FaVe links -> APKeep
topology, and FaVe source->probe compliance checks -> APKeep existential
reachability (ReachabilityChecker, P3).

The AbstractVerificationEngine methods are called incrementally, but APKeep
builds the whole network at once (Network.initializeNetwork), so this BUFFERS
the FaVe model as it arrives and builds the APKeep network lazily on the first
check_compliance().

SCOPE (P4, first milestone): IPv4 dst-IP forwarding only (routers + switches),
matching wl_ifi. VLANs are dropped (redundant -- every role has a distinct IPv4
range). ACLs, slices, anomalies and flow dumps are not yet translated; see the
NotImplemented stubs and APKEEP_BACKEND.md.
